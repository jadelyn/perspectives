              <br/>
              <p>Perspectives, UC Berkeley's Multicultural Showcase, focuses on the space between our footsteps with the hxstories (an “x” is used to validate every story), and experiences every student carries with them as they move through campus. How do we connect our past experiences to our future struggles and achievements? How do we come to terms with our perspectives of one another based on trials and tribulations? 
                <br><br>The discomfort, angst, and words never spoken often fall into the spaces between our footsteps as we travel along our own paths. Perspectives serves as a space in which students and the community at large can intentionally engage with themes such as race, class, gender, sexuality, religion, and hxstories through all volumes of art.<br>
                <br>This year, ASUC Perspectives takes on the form of a 3 night festival, with a different set of performances each night. Join us in celebrating the talents and diversity of UC Berkeley. </p>
